This is the solution for Assignment1 question A6 in which we had to find UDP Checksum and string having same checksum
The program takes 5 commandline inputs Source IP(refered as s_id) Source port number(s_port) destination Destination IP(d_ip) destination port(d_port) and Data(data) respectively.
All the input values must be integer
